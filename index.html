  <div class="col">
    <p> After high school I didnâ€™t really know what to do. I watched my sister join the military while I just worked my little warehouse associate 9-5. I eventually had my first child and she is one of the main reasons why i got into coding in the first place. I want her to feel like her father is you know someone important. When i was 16 i fell in love with music and learned how to mix and master (Audio Engineering) vocals and create instrumentals on my own with programs such as Pro Tools, Logic, and FL Studio. You could imagine this helped me  adapt to code  easier and catch on quicker. Audio engineering is definitely fun but making it in that industry is not a walk in the park , and its more of a popularity contest than skill.I was already creating websites using wix to distribute my beats. I started looking up ways to make my websites look more professional and I stumbled across a "day in the life of a software engineer" video on youtube that changed my mindset forever. Im really enjoying my self here at Thinkful and i cant wait to take my career to the next level.</p>
